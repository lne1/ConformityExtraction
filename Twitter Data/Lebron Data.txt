Lebron when you try to pass him the ball in the 4th quarter http:\/\/t.co\/Kz2EqKZfqR
Y'all refuse to believe Lebron has faults, like y'all literally refuse to accept a fact in life that cannot be ignored.
Lebron has no post game, refuses to drive to the basket in the clutch, refuses to shoot period in the clutch, takes deep 3s but y'all ignore
Kobe's 37 shots &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Lebron no points in the second half.
@ImaMANNYiak which is most great NBA players career length. Should Lebron retire now to be fair to other stat holders?
If superstars don't take the Lebron approach they're supposed to regret it?
It's not impossible to wanna lead YOUR OWN team and see the grand scheme of things. Don't be a bitch like Lebron and team hop for rings.

Love when Lebron has to come out west and play real teams. None of this beating up on the JV Eastern Conference.
Lebron is the only player that can handpick  his own team and teammates, then complain about the situation he finds himself in.
Lebron is an expert on how to hype himself 100% in everything, &amp; also temper expectations for his teams performance. https:\/\/t.co\/VTIlOIC2IE
Lebron too busy looking like a banker from 1957 to focus on beating the Blazers http:\/\/t.co\/irMBFKrsMi
Kobe is 50 yrs old hustling for meaningless loose balls, Lebron is in the prime if his career looking for any excuse possible

@LeonelRoyce24 @shake_n_bakeN8 you're just saying stulid shit that he's gonna get a MVP and that Lebron is doing worse and shit
@LeonelRoyce24 @shake_n_bakeN8 the begging, &amp; your arguments didn't make sense cause Lebron would never let his team be 0-5 and shoot 30%
@LeonelRoyce24 @shake_n_bakeN8 and because Lebron mentality is better for a team than kobes
@LeonelRoyce24 @shake_n_bakeN8 they were already 42-20 and Lebron didn't shoot 30% from the field. And do you know what 0-5 means?
@LeonelRoyce24 @shake_n_bakeN8 0-5 when no wins. I'm saying that Lebron wouldn't let his go 0-5 with no wins at the beginning of the season
@LeonelRoyce24 @shake_n_bakeN8 yeah he's all he can do. So he's not good enough. That's why Lebron wouldn't do that cause hes not washed up
@LeonelRoyce24 @shake_n_bakeN8 Lebron didn't have help through 04-09 and still no 0-5.... You're wrong sns

Lebron had a bad game, we all laughed now he about to drop 45 next game and shut everyone up.

@nohemiifrancoo kobe ain't winning another win and Lebron got 2 with at least 10 years to play he will most definitely finish with more
I need me both a Eric Bledsoe jersey and a Lebron cavs jersey before seasons end

Heat will still sell out games like tonight but intensity and crowd is less extreme without Lebron.
Lebron having two of the worst games of his career to start the season.
Lebron Compares Losing And The Process To \*Rebuilding A Car From Scratch\*: http:\/\/t.co\/3hRA0Rvna3
When Lebron James said bad habits, he meant Dion Waiters.
Durant out, Kobe in LA mess, Lebron struggling. Anthony Davis is on top of the NBA.
Lebron basically watched the Cavs take bad shots as he stood in the perimeter. Game was already out of hand but definitely hoping team grows
Lebron James stat line: 32pts, 12rbs, 10assts, 9-17 FG's, 13-17 FT's, 1stl, 1blk.

@AJyoungin24 but if he asks for a trade we still talking about Lebron leaving Cleveland?
@AJyoungin24 because of Lebron james no other reason u have to admit those teams weren't that good they lost to orlando
@AJyoungin24 That's very debatable Lebron james makes players around him look great because of his passing ability they weren't that good
@AJyoungin24 the city of Cleveland lost a million dollars in value because of Lebron leaving
@AJyoungin24 Lebron accounted for 27.3 wins last year tell me that doesn't mean playoffs or lottery
@AJyoungin24 they still had most of the same players except Lebron

Why is Kobe being talked about? Lebron playing a much worse game should be topic of slander.
@RyanMcdonald03 yup. He will be gone from the game soon. People take him for granted. Will be that way with Lebron too. Sad.
@RyanMcdonald03 Agreed on both. Lebron will be Top 6 when he retires for sure.
@RyanMcdonald03 Same. Both great in their own regard. Im sure Lebron will play better as this season goes by
@RyanMcdonald03 Lebron could have taken 20+ shots if he wanted to and got his 20 points. Idk why he only took 12
@BestGreatHeroic how did Lebron play last night?

@PhillyPC88 KD, Lebron, Rudy Gay
@PhillyPC88 I would have -- I would have been like \*Bring in Melo and Lebron, i'll play for free\*
Lebron looked good today but Kevin Love won't ever be the same in Cleveland. He needs to come to LA.
Lebron has been playing horrible defense this year -- don't you have to play atleast decent defense to be the \*best player in the world\*?
@RTSportsTalk @Mamba_Lakers24 I'd draft prime Lebron before prime Kobe, but prime Kobe was probably the better player.
@Mamba_Lakers24 @RTSportsTalk Lebron's peak was 2012-2013 probably.
Lebron couldn't do any better with this roster

@yeaumad @MiamiHEAT @KingJames @NBA @DwyaneWade Need I remind you of Ray Allen's timely 3 either where Bosh said jesus pass fuck you Lebron!
@yeaumad @MiamiHEAT @KingJames @NBA @DwyaneWade @spurs Yet on still outplayed Lebron while taking a back seat to let him try to lead.
@yeaumad @MiamiHEAT @KingJames @NBA @DwyaneWade @spurs On a per minute basis Wade outplayed Lebron it's not his fault Lebron couldn't carry.
@yeaumad @MiamiHEAT @KingJames @NBA @DwyaneWade @spurs Bitch please Lebron turned Kawhi into a fucking MVP he's not even a all star mind you
@SELF_MADEest89 Kobe still somehow shot better than Lebron despite shooting it 37 times got to FT line more to poor Cleveland Timberwolves.
@NBA He was never bad in @MiamiHEAT just his scoring usage decrease year over year while Lebron was with team.
@NBA @MiamiHEAT Bosh &amp; Wade basically adapted to roles they were made to play into since Lebron couldn't cope &amp; handle a reduced usage role.
@NBA @MiamiHEAT I do find it funny though since Lebron made comments like it was Kyrie's team to lead and his actions don't seem to back it.
@NBA @MiamiHEAT When Cleveland struggles Lebron will deflect blame onto them rather than shouldering it will that get under their skin maybe
@NBA @MiamiHEAT With both Bosh &amp; Wade they both tasted playoff success w\/o Lebron so the scrutiny they could easily just shrug it off.

Kyrie and Dion Waiters shot 19 shots in the 2nd half. Lebron? 4. Magical.
\*It got to the point where Lebron watched and sat in the corner..\* Lollll
RT @jordankwheeler: Lebron, Love, Kyrie now is much better than Lebron, Bosh, Wade...ever.
RT @DaltonHedrick12: Lebron, Love, Kyrie is better than Lebron, Bosh, Wade. Once they get pieces around them, Cleveland is winning some cha\u2026
RT @JosephJuza18: Personally, a big three of Lebron Kevin Love and Kyrie Irving is much better than a Lebron Chris Bosh and Dwayne Wade big\u2026
RT @papercash: Kyrie is better than Wade...Lebron go home bro
@Cochran1043 Lebron is running that entire show. He is the one that is supposed to have the answers.
Where does Lebron go for answers in Cleveland? He signed up for this. It was his choice. Such an idiot.
RT @Spoon_r13 Instead of realizing Bosh played out of position and sacrificed HIS stats for Lebron to have open lanes...people bash him.
RT @Spoon_r13 I really hope Udonis Haslem spits in Lebron's face and power bombs him right on the Heat symbol.
RT @Spoon_r13 Pat Riley raised a family...adopted Lebron...he raped the entire family, stole some money, and left.
RT @Spoon_r13 Deng is having dinner with Riley and Spo....Lebron still hasn't met his head coach. Clown organization bro.
At least Lebron went home....he's a good guy.
You KNOW how bad Cleveland organization is? I actually am starting to feel bad for Lebron. ME!
RT @AKuperstein: Lebron shutout in the 2nd half, his team loses by 19 and media is preaching patience. Oh how things have changed...
RT @Spoon_r13 A PERSON that tells you that you shouldn't be UPSET about Lebron leaving (especially the way he left) is misinformed.
RT @Spoon_r13 The P.R. spin was amazing. Some how makes Lebron seem like the good guy. Amazing stuff.
RT @Spoon_r13 Can't wait for Lebron to shoot 45% next season and people think he's struggling
RT @Spoon_r13 Lebron is the GM, coach, and party planner...exactly why he LEFT Cleveland in the 1st place. Amazing stuff.
RT @Spoon_R13: Chris Bosh gets to play under banners. Lebron gets to play under Rich Paul\u2019s dick.
RT @B_Sittinger13: @BackZican bc if we took him back after the way he screwed us it would be pathetic. I'd rather suck than have Lebron bac\u2026
RT @B_Sittinger13: @BackZican I just hate Lebron so much. He is an amazing player. But I hate him as a person. I don't want him. #KyrieIsTh\u2026
RT @CaneFin: LOL Lebron is a one man show trying to change the culture of a whole NBA franchise right now. He wanted the challenge? He got \u2026
\u201c@SherwoodStrauss: Kyrie wasn't even screened and Lillard got 10 feet of separation. In the halfcourt. Pray for Blatt\u201d Lebron did it himself
\*I had kisses all over my face...yesterday it was just a good hand shake.\*-Pat Riley on Lebron's exit meeting
\*The 4 years that we had here with Lebron...we hope turns into an 8 or 10.\*-Pat Riley....WHAT AN IDIOT!!!!
Lebron smokes man lank.
RT @Spoon_r13 Lebron left Pat Riley for a first time GM so his friends could book flights and he could be familiar with the street names.
RT @Spoon_r13 Gonna tell you right now...Lebron is gonna look back as an old man and regret leaving this organization.
AND Yes...Lebron losing weight was dumb. Said it when it happened. He was pound for pound the best athlete I've ever seen.
When they tell me Lebron won rings by himself http:\/\/t.co\/bNz1adYfrf
\u201c@A_Vasquez17: Kyrie Irving is shooting about 34% &amp; Kevin Love is shooting about 41%...\u201d Lebron won rings by himself.
Lebron 1\/4. Kyrie 1\/5, Love 1\/3. LOLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL. So magical with that ball movement.
I got told Lebron James losing weight would make him faster. WEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE.
Championship level D by Lebron here https:\/\/t.co\/vYGIAJbZqe
@YelhsamiiH @Pr3ttyBrwn_Eyez @DeezNuts but I thought we all left when Lebron did? Faggots.
\*Lebron did it himself\* http:\/\/t.co\/BphAScQOB4
\u201c@BaseyCrock: The Cavs gave up 42 in the 3rd quarter to the celtics\u201d Lebron did it himself.
Lebron with another 40 minute game...
41 minutes for Lebron in a regular season game vs this celtics team lol.
If someone wants to look it up...I'd bet Lebron has played more 40 minute games this season than all of last (not including playoffs).
Lebron had 21 40+ minute games ALL of last season with the Miami Heat....in 7 games this season w\/ the Cavs...he already has 6.

RT @DavidAmoyal: @terrenceKC @juveennio I knew Lebron was staying the minute Wade walked away from $42 million guaranteed, the fix is in
RT @DavidAmoyal: Remember when half of Twitter was convinced Lebron was leaving Miami?
RT @DavidAmoyal: @Solano_56 good point, I really thought he would walk and go to Knicks. But Lebron ain't coming back
RT @DavidAmoyal: If Wade thought Lebron was leaving the Heat there is no way he walks away from that guaranteed money #PreviousTweet
RT @DavidAmoyal: Let me save you some time, Lebron is staying with Heat- fact that Wade walked away from $42 million guaranteed proves it
RT @DavidAmoyal: I seriously doubt Lebron is leaving the Heat after this season

RT @JohnnyNBA: Lebatard reminded me of the time the Lakers beat the Cavs by 55 points and Lebron tweeted \*Karma is a b****\*\* Ha.
RT @MIKESLYFE: Funny but I don't cheer against Cleveland cause of Lebron.. I cheer against Cleveland cause of Cleveland.

@TheDeusxD don't matter he still had new players like you said Lebron does and im saying its dumb to say that
@TheDeusxD Cuz of the new players Lebron has right?
@TheDeusxD you said Lebron has to get use to his new teammates so it's gonna take times yes?
@TheDeusxD this has nothing to do with the coach or the system in talking new teammates for Lebron that you brought up
@TheDeusxD my point is the cavs are fine they will win 55 games and be 1-2 in the east so you and Lebron and all other need to stop with the
@TheDeusxD no that was my example of the new teammates thing I'm saying I hate that Lebron makes excuses if they don't win the title
@TheDeusxD no shit but Lebron didn't need to say it was gonna take time he was already making excuses if they don't win and I hate that
@TheDeusxD oh ik but it's Lebron that said it that bothered me he shouldn't have told a fan base that hasn't won in 63 years hey you may
@TheDeusxD idk I think wade is getting worse with his knees and that's mostly the reason Lebron left bosh is gonna need to play like crazy

Lebron James made 4 baskets last night in the basketball game.
Worst takes:  1. Lebron is a super genius \*teaching them kids\* a lesson by not helping. 2.  Lebron rebuilt a car once
You have to be so dumb to think that Lebron is cool with scoring 11 points on 4-12 shooting because he wants to make a point.
Lebron was so efficient his last season in Miami.   Like, unreal.  Where is that guy??
@reverendvargo seriously though, they idea that Lebron would purposely be bad to make a point is terrible
@RailbirdJ But Lebron is a super genius who memorized Madden plays
@37CrookshankAve are you comparing him with Lebron?
@JShikner Remember back in the days when Lebron was better than him?  I KID I KID
@MikeyFiveBucks Lebron fans are and always will be the funnest to troll
Have to hand it to the ABJ by staying on message when Lebron has bad games by blaming his teammates for making him decide to play bad.
@Nominataur @demeatloaf @MattNewsHerald @DavidZavac Lebron has a bad game and you're talking about trading Dion?  Lol
@MattNewsHerald @Nominataur @demeatloaf @DavidZavac ok but Lebron has to play better.
@Nominataur @demeatloaf @MattNewsHerald @DavidZavac ok then.  you're right.  Lebron is the problem, obviously.
Windhorst explaining Lebron James motives and Kyrie Irving leadership issues will never end, will it?
@mattkasinecz @demeatloaf @ManiacMagLee @Nominataur @MattNewsHerald @DavidZavac being purposefully bad is something Lebron would do? Really?
@demeatloaf @mattkasinecz @ManiacMagLee @Nominataur @MattNewsHerald  in a Lebron world where being a bad teammate is being a good teammate
I don't think Lebron James is actually being passive to teach anyone a lesson.  I think that's totally crazy. He just had bad games.
@ClevStrikesBack Lebron 4-12 and none after the first half??
@jacobjbg the media trying to sell Lebron's bad games as something he has control over.
@10CanBananaMilk effort has been an issue with Lebron before.  It comes with the territory, but letting teammates lose on purpose???
@10CanBananaMilk Lebron can't be happy with this story.
@AlexRaffalli @ClevStrikesBack This team needs Lebron to lead on the court with his talent to be successful. Why do I even have to say that?
\*This notion that there is no way in hell that Lebron would leave again, that would be a grave mistake.\* - Stephen A.   PANIC PANIC PANIC
Wait, Stephen A Smith is saying Lebron took last night off because he was mad that Tristan Thompson wasn't extended???
So what, according to SAS Lebron isn't teaching a lesson to the players, but to the front office?  What???
Did anyone ask Lebron about Tristan Thompson's contract since the deadline to extend passed?
@SeanIn60Seconds but Windhorst and the ABJ are more reliable?   Who called Lebron to Miami?
@BigFun4040 @WFNYKirk @CavsWITNESS is Lebron butthurt about Tristan Thompson not being extended or is he butthurt about Kyrie's habits?
Lebron just did what everyone was unhappy with Irving for doing
Has anyone taken a close look and written about Lebron James losing lift?  I keep seeing tweets, but has anyone written a piece?
@RyanPGoldchains Can't see putting my kid in a Lebron James jersey, but I think they have a Kyrie one.

Seriously if Lebron doesnt start acting like Lebron.. w\/ dat weight lost... We have to start asking if he's okay... Like for real...
Ill give it to Christmas before I start demanding answers about Lebron health...
@cfrank_ i know Lebron isnt Kobe, but calling him a quitter is blasphemy
@Treyhefnerr why Lebron didnt score in the 2nd half?

Off the HGH RT\u201c@HorrorGod666: Lebron didn\u2019t score in the 2nd half. Man what the hell?\u201d

Lebron took so much steroids even his headband got diesel. #StayWoke
RT @sup_nmu: Lebron should probably get off his \*no carb diet\* (get back on HGH).
@DutchieFlair @Astrochologist basically. Lebron had kush HGH that\u2019s all. Kobe was trey bag dirt.
@bshelly24 @HotFiyaStarter that\u2019s the angle? Lebron MO is bust in the air and jam up when they beef pop.

Apparently Lebron is pulling the Apolo Creed method to motivating the cavs. I dont buy it http:\/\/t.co\/pawwRMXGjm
Can Lebron let me know which games he decides to not try so he can send a message so I can bet the house on their opponent? Would be nice
@AnthonyLimaFAN how long till the Lebron 1 yr deal issue starts popping up?
@ChrisFedor And Lebron shouldn't intentionally not play bc he wants to teach lessons. Its all odd. Not panic but def lots of work
\*Anyone who thinks Lebron doesn't look different is fooling themselves. Plays under the rim\* Simmons. Exactly. Needs to be investigated

509484615
As much as Cleveland hates him I think Windy nailed it in my last RT. Lebron will let KI and DW fail to get them to do it his way.
Ultimately you will see Lebron play like Lebron, control the ball, run the offense through him and be Lebron. Then everything will change.
Lebron will not continue to let Kyrie run the offense. He has never done that anywhere he has been. Look for a huge Lebron type game soon.
Lebron is playing possum. He will have that huge game and tell the team your way failed, my way worked. Which way do you want to do this.
The notion that Lebron is hurt or is a diminished athlete due to his weight loss is absurd. He is the same Lebron. Its chemistry issues.
When Lebron says \*its a process\* he means its going to take time to get Dion and Kyrie to play team ball. #Cavs
Lebron could take over, get early season wins, but it would not pay dividends in the post season. This will. #Cavs
@GodL0vesCLE so is melo, Lebron and Wade. kobe is coming back for veteran minimum.
So maybe Lebron should go check Anderson. #Cavs
Maybe #Lebron is not running through people because of the wear it has put on his body. Avoiding some contact might add years in his career
Think about the damage you would at 250LBS running full speed into other 240LB guys 10 times a night. Lebron may just be changing his game
#Lebron seems all about longevity now and extending his career. Not seeking out contact would fit the mold. #Cavs
When Kyrie is on fire like this #Lebron needs to get his ass out of the corner, move, set picks and help Kyrie, give options, not watch.
See #Cleveland - its gonna be OK. #Cavs  Now someone get #Lebron  Victory Steak and a glass of raw eggs.
With Kyrie and Lebron its hard to imagine how the #Cavs will not be able to close out games. Two guys who are at their best in the 4th.
She asked Kyrie if Lebron got above the rim tonight. HahahahahaahahAhaha. Allie rules. #Cavs
Friday she should ask Lebron if he is eating steak again and how his sore back is. #Cavs
\u201c@GodL0vesCLE: Oh my. RT @JeremyinAkron: I prefer the Lebron, Mo, Delonte, Z , Boobie Cavs to these guys\u201d come on
Is Lebron still the best player in the league - YEP. Are the observations that he has lost some lift, strength and a step valid - YEP. #Cavs
@djmjrules but maybe you are right and I did not watch enough of Lebron in Miami
David Blatt does realize that Lebron James is not a terminator?  He can't keep playing him 40 minutes a night.  #Cavs
Lebron needs Kyrie to do what he is doing and work harder on defense and play team ball. If KI and James lead the rest will follow. #Cavs
Lebron 41 pts 7 assists and 4 rebounds. I'm gonna stop talking about what's wrong. Post HGH, less explosive balding Lebron is awesome. #Cavs

This is the first game that Lebron, Kevin Love, and Kyrie Irving all had a great game together

Awww Lebron is frustrated.....boo fucking who! U made the team so win or lose u should have a better attitude.
Lebron is such a bitch...it's crazy that people even respect this bitch nigga.
It's the start of the season.... Lebron just expected his team to be everything andddddd they aren't.

@Cleigh_Adams @StopRidingLBJ I'm retweeting it to state the fact. If Lebron is so called te best player in the league he should be shooting
More than 12 shots. Whys there record? 1-2. Lebron hasn't played good, they aren't playing good. He's got to take control.
Lebron is the best in the league though.  No doubt.
@Cleigh_Adams @StopRidingLBJ I dot hate Lebron I think he is the best player in the league no doubt. But what in saying is he's gotta shoot
Lebron 12's so ugly

@DannyCrawford30 obviously I don't like Lebron but I truly believe we've seen his best basketball \ud83d\ude4d
@collink91 no one is saying Lebron isn't used a lot but he's used similarly to other superstars in there prime
@DannyCrawford30 @collink91 we weren't even arguing over the sand things. My argument with Colin was the Miami Heat didn't break down Lebron
RT @MoonDoggyTR: Kobe 28 ppg on 40%shooting\nLebron 21 ppg on 40% shooting\n\nYet the conversations are so different.

@ChrisBHaynes did any media ask Lebron why he seemed completely disinterested in that game. Bigger ? To me than waiters role on this team.
@CleveRebuild @ChrisBHaynes well I guess that's one theory. Not sure how Lebron being uninvolved in the offense accomplishes that though.
According to cavs media and some fans, Lebron is purposefully playing bad and disinterested to send a message. I feel much better now.
no one has actually asked Lebron that of course. We'll all just assume that's the case. Wouldn't want to upset anyone with real questions.
@tsulz12 I think they'll be fine too. I just hate seeing Lebron stand back and watch these guys gunning.I've seen enough of that over years

So Lebron is the best player in the world, only scoring 11 points??? Wow have our standards sunk so low?
Kobe at age 37, coming off of TWO major injuries, is more effective than Lebron James
I just can't express how much it makes me sad to watch a player like Lebron James
@TheMisterRogers I meant HE needs something to chage in accordance to Lebron's performance...  My bad I was in class half paying attention

@1KingGregoHo you be trying to give Lebron too much credit lbs
@1KingGregoHo plus Lebron it will be 10-40 so whats the difference?
@1KingGregoHo ok. but you talking like Lebron had a good game tho. He was 4\/12 and had 3 t\/o, how come he not the reason they lose?

lmfaooo Lebron passing the blame off to his teammates while playing the worst basketball of his career? Jesus Christ lol
@SpikeReed and again. knicks had $30 million more to give melo. Lebron DEF had nothing to gain by coming here and losing lol
Or Lebron is gonna have to score more than 2 points over 36 minutes RT @JonesOnTheNBA LeBron is gonna have to reign in Kyrie and Dion.
Niggas mad at Kobe for shooting, not mad at Lebron for pulling a disappearing act when his team needs him. I see whats going on here lol
Interested to see if Lebron can top 40% vs the Jazz. Shouldnt be hard for \*King\* to do but idkkkkk bruh lol
Kobe doesn't shoot = \*quit on his teammate\* Lebron doesn't shoot = \*teaching a lesson\*. Jig, where art thou?
Yep we overreacting about EVERYBODY. Lebron WASHED RT @HeadcACE1906 3 games in an everyone overreacting  Jesus Christ man

Lebron is going to have a very hard time trying to break the \*ISO-ball\* habits the cavs have...that's all they've known since he left
Lebron is not used to having to take 25+ shots to win a game...but he will be after this year
This Kyrie Lebron thing doesn't work very well...anybody can run the fast break with bron JUST LAUCH THE BALL...but in half-court \ud83d\ude0f
Kevin love has to speed up his game and become more of a physical force to play alongside Lebron successfully
That Minnesota finesse stretch 4 game ain't gon work because Lebron is all the \*stretch\* anything any team needs

All Lebrons stats that r not already higher then Kobes r within 2 seasons reach.. And mind u Kobes played 7 more NBA seasons then Lebron
@DJodyHighroller but Kobe had Shaq n had players around them from 96 to 2004 and Lebron was only at the heat for 4 years? So what u mean?
@GorillaLS48 @ZustinAammar @NeMOSense @DJodyHighroller lol I can't disagree but I'm talkin Lebron nd Kobe
@LBJAintShit @Cortez_Patton lol but u talkin team ball now? We talkin Kobe n Lebron stats
@LBJAintShit @Cortez_Patton ok and Lebron grabbed his 2 in the past 3  seasons
@LBJAintShit @Cortez_Patton 3 of those came before Lebron was in the nba like I said he's played 7 more seasons then Lebron, he got time
@LBJAintShit @Cortez_Patton only thing Kobe got on Lebron is that he never left his squad which I give him his respect for that

LOL Lebron is a one man show trying to change the culture of a whole NBA franchise right now. He wanted the challenge? He got it.
Kyrie Irving cannot posses the ball as much as he does and expect to win. Lebron creates and starts offense.
@Spoon_r13 Go swing through people's comments on that Windhorst article. They're now saying Lebron misses Bosh. Never thought I'd see that.
This year Lebron will appreciate what he had in unselfish Wade and Bosh. You never know what you got till its gone, or when you left..
RT @Spoon_r13: \*I had kisses all over my face...yesterday it was just a good hand shake.\*-Pat Riley on Lebron's exit meeting
@CB_is_Legend @UptownReport Yes they can and Wade has a bit, but having Lebron here the last 4 years also got in the way of that.
@CB_is_Legend @UptownReport Wade had to settle into a role, let Lebron flourish, for the good of the team.
@CB_is_Legend @UptownReport Wade in the post has helped Wade's efficiency a ton. But yeah having Lebron helps duh.
@CB_is_Legend @AllWadeAllDay @UptownReport @AlfonsoHoops Again, the players Lebron had around him here, doubt he will find that again.

Lebron is a trip. U playing with a core of players who never won before how did he think it would be? Then he runs to his GF @WindhorstESPN
Lebron going to trade Dion Waiter in a month.
@ZaslowShow Lebron starting to look old. No lift
RT @PeterRipke7: Brian Windhorst would not have a job if it wasn't for Lebron
@PeterRipke7 I agree, dude is down right sickening how he follows Lebron around to be Lebron leak when he's not getting his way

Kobe score 39 points last night. Lebron scored 11 and 0 in the second half.    \u2615\ufe0f\ud83d\udc38
when you hand Lebron the AUX cord http:\/\/t.co\/7LKvDUluWY
@Rjedwards22 your a Lebron fan?
@SamMeuret Lebron went 4-12 with 3 turnovers. You either impact the game in a huge way or step aside and let real players do it \ud83d\ude0a
@SamMeuret don't get me wrong. I'm not dumb, 37 shots WAY TO MANY. However Kobe cut the game to 2 with a minute to go. Lebron did nothing
@SamMeuret Fair argument. however Kobe put his AWFUL team in a position to maybe win the game. Lebron did not.
@brycejpotter81 @SportsCenter that seems to be jumping the gunBetter to give your team a chance to win. instead of doing nothing like Lebron
@DBadalucco WHAT DID I DO? It's crazy Lebron fans tweets at me. you tweeted about Kobe today. Did I reply? NO lol but ok \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02

1646924262
The funniest thing is that Lebron was \*disinterested\* and \*didnt try\* because Cavs havent given Tristan an extension yet.
I gave Stephen A another chance but now I am done for life with this shit he is spewing out on First Take about Lebron\/Gilbert
So the Cleveland media assumes that Lebron is healthy because Blatt says he is? OK. So Blatt is a doctor now??????
Lebron himself has said he has back problems, and if you cant see that he isn't healthy, then you are an idiot.
@JasonLloydABJ If Lebron only scores 15 points tonight, will the media say he was disinterested? #CLUELESS
@TheKennyRoda The problem is that in this offense Lebron shouldnt be the main facilitator. Kyrie,Dion, and Love need to be...
@TheKennyRoda They ALL need to create offense for Lebron and Lebron needs to not be a 10 assist a night guy, be more aggressive on offense.
Lebron looks constipated in this picture. http:\/\/t.co\/uIcUiKWdhd

Meanwhile, the Cavs are continuing to get exposed. I love it. Poor defense and poor floor spacing. Leaving Lebron vulnerable \ud83d\ude08
\u201c@MoonDoggyTR: Kobe 28 ppg on 40%shooting\nLebron 21 ppg on 40% shooting\n\nYet the conversations are so different.\u201d You said it, not me.
@SwimPigeon you just called him trash. How on earth is he trash? You sound like he hurt you. Shooting the same % as Lebron with a poor team.
@Its_Gooch irrelevant. He still shot a higher % than Lebron, Kyrie, and Melo did last night. It's simple math.
Lebron is shooting 40% this season. Kobe is shooting 40% this season. Lebron is taking 21 spg, Kobe is taking 28.
Kobe's PER is 20. Your lord and savior, Lebron, has a PER of 15.9. Gon worry about him.
@Its_Gooch who said it was? Regardless him and Lebron are still shooting the same % this season..except Kobe is more efficient with a 20 PER
RT @MyTweetsRealAF: My TL funny. People talking about how Kobe force to many shots. People talking about how Lebron don't force the issue. \u2026
Trip Dub Lebron. Let's see if he can sustain his effectiveness.
RT @_Iwishyouwould: Lmao who told yall Lebron is washed? I've never seen that statement before.
RT @LBJAintShit: \*@YouSoThotful: Lebron 31\/11\/10 Bruh just give that man the MVP already\* last week \*it's too early\* for LeBron fans this w\u2026
\u201c@CountOnRahul: Lebron couldn't do any better with this roster\u201d especially since he's passive. He'd pass the ball to Sacre every damn play.
RT @JesseGladsaget: Yeah, Lebron had a better playoff run than KD last year, but you have to factor in the HUGE disparity in the competitio\u2026

I could Love leaving Cleveland. Sounds crazy right? About as crazy as AI, Melo, Wade &amp; Lebron winning a bronze.
I could see Love leaving Cleveland if as a FA. Sounds crazy right? About as crazy as AI, Melo, Wade &amp; Lebron winning a bronze.
@davehydesports Lebron went to Cleveland to do less &amp; he's finding out that's a fantasy.
Lebron isn't as publicly outspoken as a superstar w\/ a rookie coach needs to be.
@LeBatardShow Is exposing the hypocrisy surrounding Lebron's Cleveland return. Cause gutting the TWolves of their only superstar is ok.

1933991814
It actually seems like Lebron gonna have to change his game more than Kyrie or Kevin Love....something he's not used to.
@hammertime1009 @HeadcACE1906 @JBucks614 maybe it's Lebron that don't fit. Lol
@hammertime1009 @HeadcACE1906 @JBucks614 yep...but I, watching these highlights, and Lebron is pretty much allergic to defense too
Lebron is upset cuz Tristan Thompson didn't get his extension yet?\n\nWhat the FUK is wrong with Lebron?
Lebron had the first ever hairline toupee....took it off, and things ain't been the same since
Lebron had 32 and 10 while Kyrie had 32 and 9\n\nWhat do u do about that?
@YeIIowbang @ToreMyACL @King_Kid_Outlaw that's true...you only get two (Lebron)
@benjaminsxo yep..and did u not see what happened when Lebron guarded him in the fourth quarters?\n\nIt was over.
@klew24 @DamnitCorn @whysotrill Lebron wish his head bands would stretch out like them areolas.
When Mo Williams said he was contemplating retirement after Lebron left Cleveland... http:\/\/t.co\/g0IbIvbxe8
@mrsolodoloboss Lebron Jr not playin tho

71744269
That \*Unselfish\* crap gon end RT @Check_Woodz: Lebron been slawing out in Cleveland so far, but I\u2019m sure that won\u2019t last long.
At some point Lebron gotta take over man....I know he want to get everybody involved man but nobody on his team has that experience.
Thats ALWAYS been my problem with Lebron. But I digress. Yall get in yall feelings bout \*Baby Bron Bron\*
It doesnt matter if my Lakers are doing horrible, facts be facts. Lebron shy away from the moments. Sorry.
Aye @stephenasmith stop defending this Lebron dude
Hold on....Kobe shouldnt be in MVP runnings but Lebron should?? Wow. Yall negroes are crazy.
People really think I dislike Lebron...I mean I do but blame yall.

Lebron isn't performing, why is everyone turning the cheek on the fact that last night he almost hit the lowest points in his career?!
Lebron left Miami with Rings, MVP titles yet he's playing like a rookie. Is everyone turning the cheek on that too? someone enlighten me.
@Freebandz1017 I don't hate Lebron. It's more of a media thing. Lebron was despised when he was in Miami. Now he's a hero? Gtfoh
@Freebandz1017 &amp; if that's the case why is Miami proving that they don't need Lebron to win ?
@Freebandz1017 you're riding Lebron a little too hard. If he's such a powerhouse why isn't he performing in Cleveland?

Lebron tryna make them guys comfortable before he takes over the offense and starts handling the ball all the time lol.I see what he's doing
It was the same thing on the Heat..Lebron started off averaging around 19 and barely shooting..then once guys got comfortable he took off
Kobe and Lebron had games like they had last night at the peaks of their careers..So I don't see what the big fuss is about..
Lebron has A history of showing A lack of aggression at times...Kobe has A history of being overly aggressive..what's new here?
Were Lebron and Kobe washed when they were doing this same shit in '06?'07?.
look at Lebron washed ass..turning back the clock to..to...last year..
Dwade had A guy on his team that could lift the extra weight when he sat out..They gone need D Rose to be the Lebron of the team eventually.
Lebron been the best player in the league since '07...
'07 Made me realize that Lebron's impact on the court was 2nd to none..Any team with him on it is A better 1..
Since Lebron 1st made the playoffs..he's never had A team that didn't have at least A fighter's chance to play on the big stage..
You can say whatever you want about Lebron...but you can't deny the nigga's impact on A basketball team..at least give him that..
Lebron might get his 1st 40 piece of the season tonight..
Nevermind the 40 piece..Lebron still A serviceable defender or nah?
Rondo couldn't do shit against Lebron in the 4th..
Lebron should be at 25k points at the end of the season..

Started a MyGM with the Cavs, traded Kyrie for Curry and Lebron for KD, drafted Thon Maker who is ranked a 96, and got Kobe in FA.
@iloveCALi_ but I don't think Lebron is either lol only player close to Jordan is Kareem and maybe Wilt
@JohnnyDaGOAT nope. Never has before. Always had the ball in his hand. And Lebron NEEDS the ball in his hand.
@NBA_TALK__ cool. Still shooting better than Lebron. Is Lebron breaking the cycle? Love is playing the best on that team
Lebron phone blowing up \n http:\/\/t.co\/9ciBQS1lrb
@Teen_Titans23 @LouieSasa @RawMahdi @NbaEveryday10 yeah Lebron said he loved Cleveland and then he left.
Lebron balled out tn. But so did Davis.
Lebron actually didn't have a triple double lol they gave him an assist he wasn't even involved in and a rebound.
#FaxOwnLee. RT \*@ShawnsPlanet: Lebron is now the most overrated player of all time.\*
@ryan25jackson @ShawnsPlanet Lebron should only have 1 too. Got bailed out by his teammates. Nigga got outscored by Danny Green through 3 gm
@ryan25jackson @ShawnsPlanet Lebron would have been too lol but he wouldn't have put up the numbers kobe did bc LeLayup can't shoot

Kobe dropped 40 last night &amp; ppl put his face in a washer machine. Lebron dropped 11 points &amp; y'all designing \*King Bron Bron\* t shirts.
Does Kevin Love not like playing with Lebron? Don't see why he would consider signing with the Lakers

So Lebron teaching his team a \*lesson\* by not going out and taking over LOL
I can see what Lebron tryna prove to his teammates but naaaah you still gotta be competitive

Lebron gotta go bald
Refs so gay for Lebron man wow lmfaooo

Lebron gets every call man lmfaooooo
Lebron Harden
We also dont have a SF lol RT @Thirst22: Lebron \u201cwashed\u201d ass has 27, 9, 8 tonight so far.
@RJJ954 @StephGhost we have no SF so Lebron was gonna get his. Kyrie 25 in the 2nd half not happening every night

51994850
@TheExpert91 Lebron tends to have big games in Portland. This cavs team just ain't gd enough to win vs a solid team. No chemistry yet
@TheExpert91 no rose for the 2nd half and no butler to defend Lebron so Imo that takes way from the win
@TheCavsNation is Lebron trying to teach a lesson by playing bad. I'm confused. Kyrie and Dion gta move the ball more.
Kyrie n Lebron are useless.
Lebron is so shit now kmt
Kyrie is chucking contested shots. Lebron is bricking
@smoothkobra I been saying Lebron loos different from the home opener. Pre season he seemed alright tho.
That drive is probably the most explosive Lebron has looked
These cavaliers can all get fired. Lebron  and kyrie can get fired first.
A Lebron dunk. Ain't seen that is years
The most active Lebron has looked in ages
Lebron always complains after he misses and never runs back. Shut up man
Damon jones is a shooting coach for the cavs???? Loool. This guy is clearly here cos of Lebron. Lebron brings all his friends man

25201755
Overly unselfish Lebron is kind of annoying.
You'll have my support Lebron panickers if he played how he did last night at game 20. Highly doubt that will happen tho.
I know @JeremyinAkron would have rather had Gordon Hayward sign that offer sheet for the cavs instead of getting Lebron for many reasons
\*@JeremyinAkron: Hahahahaha .. Adam and Dustin just said Lebron looks like he's lost a step ..\*I trust them as much as I trust your analysis
RT @indiansplayoffs: Thank god Lebron only signed for one year...

\*@MarkSkog: Are you that desperate for attention?  \u201c@JeremyinAkron: I miss the Lebron that could dunk\u201d\*dunked twice in the first half
Lebron has had zero help tonight. He's the player getting dogged the most on here. Comes with the territory.
Lebron missed 2 layups tho

92345200
Yea? RT @beastlnAharl0t: Aren't you a Lebron fan though? RT @JayUncut: Kobe a lil too full of himself imo. He starting to get on my nerves
FloRida lame ass covered Lebron name on a Heat jersey with tape. Nigga too emotional.
@beastlnAharl0t Lebron no where near full of himself
Other Heat fans shouldn't do anything to a Lebron 6 jersey unless they gonna frame it
Lebron can still save his prime by coming back to Miami

38607067
hope anthony davis drops 30pts,10 reb,10 blocks and 10 ast on Lebron tonight and dunks on Lebron for the game winner
i been telling yall Bosh can HOOP.He took a backseat to bron n wade....yes he did have some SHIT games, but so did Lebron in 2011
difference btw Bosh and Lebron is, Bosh wasn't being compared to MJ or Kobe,bron is\/was so the bar  set MUCH higher
Lmaoooo Lebron airballs his three point attempt and not even bein guarded
Faggot RT @NoMeek_JustMilz: That Nike &amp; Lebron commercial fire
@HeisenJokerberg @NBASlander non-roid Lebron would have dunked that
RT @2chainzNaCup: 4. He started pinning shots on the backboard like Lebron
Wait Lebron LOSING?!you shoulda told me! RT @NBASlander: We\u2019re DISMANTLING the Cavs right now.
Lebron losing to the Celtics is always funny
Lebron is the GOAT....of getting amazing teammates to bail him out and take all credit for their success.
Lmaooo Lebron grabs the defender,injures him and somehow its a foul on the defender
Lmfaooo Lebron grabbed jeff green and hurt him and its a foul on jeff green.LMAOOOO.
The announcers are PISSED.They just said \* Look at the great Lebron....im happy with the no call\* lol
He grabbed jeff green,injured him yet somehow Lebron got fouled lmfaoooo RT @MusikFan4Life: #And1 LeBron James
Lebron is literally unguardable if he can grab u,push u out the way and its a foul on u lol
Rondo loves getting blocked by Lebron

20950220
Every game I've watched, it just seems like Lebron is playing weird. He's not playing like he was the last 4 years. He dominated back then
Idk, it could be just me. But Lebron just really looks uncomfortable in this offense.
Personally I think the offense should have Lebron at the core. That's when he is at his best and makes everyone around him better.
New theory: Lebron took his talents to South Beach. He never said he brought them back. He just said he came home. His talent is in Miami!
Harris looks better than Lebron

327014155
Be cool if Torii Hunter can come out with ESPN article called \*I'm Coming Home\* to Minnesota just like Lebron did.
@AndrewWMarshall lol, in 5 games. He'll get it up, Just like Lebron will
@AndrewWMarshall how could I be upset when I'm laughing haha. Lebron's playing awful so far, yet I know him and Kobe will still be good
@AndrewWMarshall Plain and simple, you hate the Lakers and Kobe because they've been great. \ud83d\ude04 same reason why I hate Lebron.
Lot of NBA stars struggling early. Melo, Lebron, Kobe, Harden will get it going. #82Games
@TTenPass of the guys in the 30,000 point club, Kobe has the most assists. Lebron and Michael both average more shots a game.

525708351
C'mon Lebron, go off!! I haven't seen you go off in too long\ud83d\ude29
Goodness Lebron why are you playing like this man
Good shot and then assist by Lebron. Keep it up.
C'mon Lebron, start lighting up
Good shot Lebron
THIS IS HOW WE DO, 2 GAMES AT ONCE #Pistons #Lebron #LEGGO http:\/\/t.co\/UmJuf9YtjI
I think Lebron Love and Kyrie are slowly learning how to put on a show. But learning very slow.
Kobe just broke the record of most missed shots in NBA history...aye he's better than Lebron tho right?\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02
Still the third quarter and Lebron got 31 points\ud83d\ude4c
Lebron with 40 points
YES THAT GAME! Good game Cavs!! Lebron with 41 points, 7 assists, shooting 59% !!!!!!!! \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25 #BRONBRON
I swear I could watch the player introductions to Lebron's homecoming game over and over and not get sick of it
I hate Lebron fans that pretend to not like Lebron anymore cuz he switched teams, smh fake ass Lebron fans scared to be call a bandwagon\ud83d\ude12\ud83d\ude12

2860246668
@poketiste He was good while he had Lebron on his team but without Lebron he's way better, Bosh loves being the leader of his team
@poketiste When Lebron opted out Bosh could've signed with Houston, but he wouldn't be the #1 scoring option cuz Houston has Harden and
@poketiste Howard, he stayed with Miami cuz now that Lebron is gone he has freedom to do what he wants
Lebron needs to just shave his head
@OnlyTheNBA Lebron it's not that hard, just shave your damn head \ud83d\ude02
@nbanews2341 @legendscourt And since Lebron is Lebron everyone will vote for him regardless, and his team is better and has a better shot

2291144305
How many losses would it take before someone on Twitter recommends trading Lebron?  #Cavs
@AndyResnik exactly.  Lebron will opt out too.  They\u2019re not going anywhere.
Breaking Rumor: Kevin Love and Lebron will opt out of current contracts at the end of season\u2026.and sign bigger ones\u2026.with the #Cavs.
I hate to say it, but I think Lebron is playing hurt.
@JeremyinAkron Lebron must have read our conversation at halftime.
What\u2019s wrong with Lebron? It took him until 2 minutes left in the fourth to get his triple double.

Lol Lebron shoved him
I hate that shot by Lebron
Lebron needs to pretend like everyone hates him again
@Efrisco_ You're welcome Cleveland.... There's something to that tho, he needs to start playing like \*bad guy\* Lebron
Lebron didn't break the rim there?
Thank you Lebron. I needed to see that
@mr_gause Lebron loves you DG. He wants you back as a Clevelander

2733614674
If I'm the coach I'm making Kevin love shoot the most shots kyrie needs to become a pg. and Lebron ur a bitch so jus do everything else
Lebron doesn't step up here when he's suppose to
Put Lebron on Anderson shoulda been happened called cross matchup and make him defend James. Am I that smart or coach that dumb
Why does Lebron keep passing tho!?? He got Anderson on him with layups
Lebron dunk that!!!!!!!!! Stop being a bitch!!!!!!!!!!
See what happens when Lebron drives and doesn't shoot. I'm good huh
C'mon Lebron stop passing ur team wins when ur aggressive
Lebron for as good as he is makes his team bad at times.
This is a game Lebron should have 50 and the win but he plays like a bitch all the time.
Cavs win if they drive every position and don't pull up for stupid shot or Lebron does pick and roll and tries to pass the ball. He drives
Why does kyrie have the ball and not Lebron!!!! How does this coach have a job!??? I don't understand how u take the ball out lebrons hands

46741654
So weird when Lebron doesn\u2019t even get a touch on a possession
Lebron isn\u2019t a part of the offense lol this is amazing
Lebron has complained to the refs often since high school. How is it that everyone is just noticing?
Old Lebron dunks that
Not buying Lebron's new shoes until he proves you can still move well in them
Lebron has a triple double and it still looks like he hasn't even really exerted himself most of the game
Lebron made 31 11 and 10 look easy tonight
@WitMiBBall @Cavsanada I DEFINITELY should rewatch now. I feel like Love could've done a lot more. Lebron defensively too

@benjaminsxo lol yea Lebron

Lebron got a triple double

20877950
So what the hell?  I thought the \*rip\* move was now a non-shooting foul?  But they just gave it to Lebron... #NOPatCLE
Did look like much contact on Lebron on that replay... #NOPatCLE
Um....Rivers clearly stopped moving, Lebron jumped into him, and foul?  Ridiculous.  I mean, not in the NBA, but like, any other league.
People try and say refs don't matter, but if Jimmy Graham got Lebron calls, we'd be looking at a Saints win this weekend.
So that WASN'T a push-off by Lebron.  Okay.  With him going back to Cavs I forgot how annoying he is to watch.
TV: Lebron has a triple-double.  ME: he has a quadruple-double if you include actual fouls not called.

@espn and riding Lebron 24\/7 definitely won't get you ANY WHERE. #HappyRiding
yo, are yall even married? Lebron is taken I think @espn
So this dude kept talking about how Lebron is God and Kobe is shit. On hearing this my jaw dropped coz how could someone be so dumb?
so I got like I was gonna give a speech to the class. \n\*Listen, how are you calling Kobe shit compared to Lebron? You have a low ball IQ.\*
then dude said \* Lebron is loyal too, he just left Cavs so he could win at least a ring for himself, and then he went back\*.........
CONCLUSION: Some Lebron fans are delusional if they think Kobe is shit and has done nothing for the game.
how's Lebron doing?

When Lebron said he owed y'all one he wasn't kidding at all

@kkmoriiii Think about this: they failed to get Lebron OR Carmelo; so they enacted plan B; get names just to fill up seats and tank away.
@LakesQueen I guess we'll see what happens over the next course of games. If CLE fails to win a title, expect Lebron &amp; Love to opt out.
Oh, Lebron, Kyrie, and K.Love combined for 86? Cute, Kobe and some bum ass nigga named Smush combined for 94. #Lakers
@CountOnRahul Lebron might as well have NO choice but to stay at CLE, Rudy's thriving at Sac-town, and KD could stay at OKC or WAS.
@garykester Their pitch was weak, specifically for Melo, that is. Everyone knew Lebron was never gonna go to LA anyway, and Melo was close
@ESPN can you faggots get off your Illuminati bosses' nutsack and quit worshiping Lebron like how North Koreans worship Kim Jong-Un?
@ESPN Yo, China, North Korea, and Russia; are you faggots done salivating Lebron's man-jizz all over yourselves? You're all gay for him.
@ESPN So how does Lebron's jizz taste, North Korea, China, and Russia? You fags done jacking off to him or what?
@ESPN Can you also do me a favor by jumping in a pit of lava while burning in agony for Lebron? You really are idiots &amp; retards. #Lakers
@ESPN In short, I hate you all, go suck Lebron's dick and get criticized more until you're all out of business. I'm praying for that 1 day.

@SevagKevorkian @cutie14377 yo she came at me bruh. She joined up with those Lebron Jokers &amp; talking down on Kobe
@Bryan_Baruch1 @NbaEveryday10 @NBA_Skits @KingJames or Lebron is selfish
RT @NafizzleGbs: Lebron getting the 2011 kobe treatment. http:\/\/t.co\/dXiyabWhGS
@ItsR0CKY dude thats not true.,Lebron was surrounded by Vets &amp; they put a kid in charge &amp; that was their failure
@ItsR0CKY dude i watched basketball my whole life. Lebron had a good team as a Cav
@ItsR0CKY So why you keep giving Lebron credit then like he took a weak team to the finals? U know it was rigged for him to get there
@ItsR0CKY that was the begining of Stern trying to make Lebron his new poster boy

I never could really compare Lebron and Jordan their games are way to different
Lebron is kinda like a hybrid.. Jordan and Magic mix
I would rather someone compare Lebron and Oscar Robertson to be honest
@wakaflockaLEN woah that's crazy! Honestly that's who they should compare Lebron too
@robrodriguezz @wakaflockaLEN I'll say Dwade in 06, Lebron in 12 and then kobe 10

@SportsCenter @lindsayczarniak better way to have your tweet read? #Lebron\/#Manning...hard to watch Sportscenter when that's all you see
@TheLionShah @danroid22 @SportsCenter you spelled Lebron wrong
@SportsCenter are there other NBA games on tonite or just the Lebron Cavs?
@SportsCenter sorry Lebron lovers upset that his avg dunk last night did not make no.1 #sad
@SportsCenter can't go an hour without tweeting Lebron, so sad.
@BleacherReport he just elbowed Jeff Green in the sack on his way to the hoop and Green gets called for a foul? This is why we hate Lebron

Where will Lebron be ranked all time?
Why is kobes 39 on 14-37 a bigger story than Lebron scoring 11 on 33% shooting?
@AmirRazipour Lebron will turn it around.
Lebron records his 1st triple double tonight.
Lebron's triple double overshadowed Anthony Davis 27&amp;14 night.

@ESPN_FirstTake @KyrieIrving @KingJames @RealSkipBayless Why is ESPN so focused on Lebron,is the NBA that depleted of any talented players?
@DaAnsahonSports  Has the NBA deteriorated so much, that the focus is on Kobe and Lebron on a daily basis?
@darrellivy @DaAnsahonSports Jim could have gotten Phil and Dwight might have stayed as well as getting other top FA outside C.A or Lebron
@darrellivy So how did Lebron win two titles or MJ without any talent?
@TheeRobMac @ESPN_FirstTake They r locked in on Brady,Cowboys,Lebron,Spurs.Not a creative forum of discussion most of the time

DWade &amp; Lebron in the opencourt used to be the SCARIEST fukin thing a defender can ever see on the court. They used to just move out the way
\u201c@summerrskyee: Lebron really turned into a little bitch no? http:\/\/t.co\/GzfEHckqEa\u201d\n\nBecame a female asss nigga
Lebron did ALOT of the little things for us. Thats what he was so important for. He wasnt only a star he did alll the little things
Now we have Luol Deng doing all the dirty work that Lebron did... Rebounding, Defending, Lockin players up 1on1 and scoring a good 16\/game
And that superstar scoring that lost in Lebron and superstar passing and leadership... Wade and Bosh are making up for.
Lebron isn't our GO TO scorer anymore... Its Chris Bosh... Which im perfectly fine with. Lebron used to run the offense.. Now wade does
All the things Lebron was good for... Collectively as a unit we make up for his loss. Everybody chips in a little bit extra. Bosh especially
So sick of Lebron getting credit for every single positive thing someone from the Heat organization does

@AhadShah9 Lebron better tho \ud83d\udc40
@AhadShah9 Lebron's career &gt;
@HusseinUbeid1 @AhadShah9 Lebron has (or is on track) to accomplish WAY more than Kobe. Rings is all he has on him
@DaniyalNaumani @HusseinUbeid1 @AhadShah9 Lebron won Finals MVP both times? Shaq won all 3. Regardless got 2 MVP's on Cleveland

Jordan is the 5th best player all time to me. No order besides Jordan:\nMagic\nLebron \nKobe \nBird\nJordan
@SimonKubrom Lebron at the end of his career will be better clearly honestly.
@SimonKubrom Why not Lebron? He can do everything Jordan does, and so could Bird, except Bird wasn't athletic.
@Hustling2bFree What can Jordan do better than Lebron? (Assuming Lebron finishes his career strong)
@Hustling2bFree As in, who is the better basketball player? Lebron relatively easy in my eyes.
@SimonKubrom Lebron is the better basketball player though, which is what I was trying to say. Lebron is overall better than Jordan
@Lefraud_ @dominizzzle Lebron is better all around though, and Lebron is a better shooter than Jordan peep the 3pt%
@Lefraud_ @dominizzzle Lebron shot 42% in a season. Shooting doesn't matter THAT much, Lebron is more complete.
Kobe not top 5? Lemme guess, Magic not top 5 either? Lebron?
@TallAssNicholas Magic Lebron Bird Kobe Jordan no order
@MyInfo10756797 @Lefraud_ @BasedChasen No order:\nMagic Lebron Bird Kobe Jordan

@BarbancourtPapi So were gonna give Lebron Credit for Miami's titles
@BarbancourtPapi Lebron won all those titles because someone else..... When have Lebron never needed help ? He always needed somebody
Lebron is never going to be mentally strong enough to win a title without leaning on someone in the finals
@BarbancourtPapi Bruh Lebron needed somebody to lean on the whole time Kobe did his 2x look at the numbers when shaq was there kobe snapped
Bosh and Wade each gave Lebron 20+ in the finals and he still lost two of his chances Pau and Bynum never gave kobe that

Lebron James held Dwyane Wade all the way back to career highs in FG% and 2 more rings.
I can't....somehow Lebron held Wade back. Did Shaq hold Kobe back too?

@matthewruiz013 @kobebryant u know damn well Wade convinced Lebron to come as well.
@matthewruiz013 no I was referring to Lebron
If Lebron wouldve waited 1 more season with the cavs Kyrie was drafted in 2011 The help he needed was on the way. All he had to do was build
Kyrie was drafted to the Cavs when Lebron decided to go to Miami he couldve stayed an built a good team with Kyrie. They could've won a ring

@LBJAintShit @doitlike_simba according to stats as of now , Lebron is way above KD right?
@LBJAintShit @doitlike_simba but we're talking about present tense right? If we talking about overall, Lebron James has 4 MVP while he has 1
@MamedovIlgiz @LBJAintShit @doitlike_simba okay? We're comparing KD and Lebron?
@MamedovIlgiz @LBJAintShit @doitlike_simba If Lebron was 6'10 he'd be undisputedly the best player in history. You're dumb af
@LBJAintShit @MamedovIlgiz @doitlike_simba exactly , so if Lebron was AD's size he'd do twice as good as any center

@austinotterpop first of all Kobe had shaq and didn't make an impact right off the bat. Lebron was tossed into the spot light as a rookie
@austinotterpop and Lebron had to surround himself with superstars, like he is now, to win.
@austinotterpop Kobe will always be better than Lebron. Point blank period.
@austinotterpop like I said Kobe didn't impact the lakers right away because of shaq. Lebron was a expected star from day one
@austinotterpop @realpjaay it's okay though Lebron will never get another ring again as long as the Kawhi makes his way the finals

@FlopCitySports you told me he promised what did he promise (Lebron Raymone James)?
This is the thing Bubba @FlopCitySports they need to play more pick and roll with Kylie and Kevin. or Lebron and Kevin
@MJCANDANCE Same with Lebron he carried those bums single handedly too.. The 2001 76ers and 2007 #Cavs worst teams to ever make it
@MJCANDANCE Lebron had a bummy roster.. Drew Gooden, Varajeao, Snow, Dan Gibson
No cheating.. True or False.. Lebron R. James has more career points than Raymond Walter Allen the IV? @FlopCitySports #Trivia
@_GetLikeMe that's right bubba.. But Lebron has passed Vincent Lamar Carter who had 4 years on him
@_GetLikeMe Lebron is # 25 .. Kobe will pass Michael next month

@abs_da_don @LSilentN what a surprise, another cock sucker Lebron homer
The first ones to say that Lebron didn't win those titles by himself are the first ones saying Wade brought titles to Miami by himself
RT @Betterduck: @JRwrz Why doesnt this happen with the Canes Jewelry? Thats right, because Wade and Lebron were scared to play football.
RT @Betterduck: @JRwrz Lebron left town cause him and his boys were getting jocked less than Jeremy Shockey at the clubs. #Beiber #Drake #L\u2026
RT @Betterduck: @JRwrz As sorry as Seantrell Henderson was, he would pick up Lebron and throw him through a wall.

@Head_HanchoooJr @marlonstew10 ok take away Shaq he has 2 he won by HIMSELF. Lebron ain't never won by HIMSELF. He has LOVE  and IRVING now\ud83d\ude34
Kobe has won by HIMSELF twice! Lebron has never won by HIMSELF still has 2 ALL-STARS on his team now... Keep striving for greatness \ud83d\ude34
@ldixon9690 bro he won them games by himself. You know Lebron isn't winning with that roster kobe had \ud83d\ude29 stop it
@Oozeawesomejuce that's true too.  kobe and LeBron aren't on the same level tho.Lebron has all the talent. It's just kobe mentally is insane
@Oozeawesomejuce \ud83d\ude02 I swear, nah you good tho. It's not everyday you have a reasonable debate about kobe and Lebron. That's a touchy subject\ud83d\ude02

@Aratan11 @LaytonM23 Jordan Lebron Shaq 4th and hell Anthony Davis gonna be better than him to
@Aratan11 bc the zen master gave him stars Lebron has never and still doesn't have a coach hell he coaches
@Aratan11 either way Lebron was at Cleveland for like what 8 years and only got ONE-ONE-TIME all star lol Kobe did have to make his own move
@Aratan11 Kobe is not better than Lebron it is not a discussion lol
@Aratan11 of course he's going to say Kobe lol no one has ever called him the greatest, manic Johnson called Lebron the greatest
@Aratan11 Lebron is a threat to mj's legacy Kobe is not lol
@Aratan11 and mj has always hated Lebron
@Aratan11 neither of them had the spotlight on them like Lebron when they first came to the league lol
@Aratan11 you're right I'm just saying neither mj or Kobe dealt with that until they had already proven themselves Lebron was there when
@Aratan11 as soon as Lebron was drafted people were already telling him he was was going to be the greatest

524997074
@ThomasDixon32 Jordan yes! Lebron hell no he had to go join two stars to get a ring when Kobe didn't look for another star to get his other
@ThomasDixon32 he was young that's why Shaq was the man \*then\*. So Lebron had the best record multiple times on the east what'd he do?
@twells_33 @ThomasDixon32 Thomas just can't except the fact Kobe is better everything Kobe has done proved he's better than Lebron easily
@ThomasDixon32 Maybe I can't agree with that 100% though. Neither did they with Lebron because of Jordan
@ThomasDixon32 Never will happen with KD in the league I say Lebron finishes with 4 but won't win within the next 3-4 years

Lebron called out Irving Waiters(not by name) after the game for their bad habits &amp; losing culture last few years. Different Leadership 23.
Lebron going after teammates in Game 3 can mean 2 things: either he's taking hard leadership stance or planning Decision 3 2016. Join Durant
Hey @ElliottPrice690 @SimonTSN690 @Bballinsider @TonyMarinaro lets take road trip to Toronto in May for East Conf finals vs Lebron! #TSN690

@SekouSmithNBA @nbadt29 lebron is a beta male. Wade was the alpha who assigned roles. Who is going to save Lebron now?
@GOUCFKNIGHTS11 @NateDuncanNBA @JonesOnTheNBA they lacked ball movement. They were good because Wade and Lebron were dominant.
@PrinceLifer @MyHoesLatin @SekouSmithNBA @nbadt29 reread some of the interviews Lebron gave after his 2011 choke. See who assigned roles.
@ScottAgness it's a better product. The regular season was not fun the last couple years. Lebron is good but hard to watch sometimes.
@ScottAgness I'm a season ticket holder who has been to 90% of all home games for the last 10 years. Watching Lebron ball wasn't fun.
@ScottAgness judging from Wade's and Bosh's comments, playing Lebron ball wasn't fun either. He's good but it's on his terms.

@DeeNice619 and why I can't please explain to me ? And you right \*Lebron fan\* since day ONE
@DeeNice619 when bosh Lebron and Wade got together that first year
@DeeNice619 tf? I'm a Lebron fan I'm not a fan of nobody team  at all where he goes i goes
Y'all be blowing me lol I'm going to cheer for Lebron no matter what !! Call me whatever you want !
@DeeNice619 Wade wouldn't have those two if he didn't have Lebron !! His knees was wearing him out that's why he said it was LEBRON TEAM
@DeeNice619 yes a healthy Wade!!!! Wade is not healthy like that anymore ! An Lebron gone ,Wade can't afford to miss many games like he did

Lebron would never talk abt Wade and Haslem like he called out Irving and Waiters. Ego gone wild. He thinks hes Kobe now.
Stephen A. already saying Lebron isnt necessarily gonna stay in Cleveland long term?!?! This is GREAT!!!
At this point @stephenasmith may as well be on Lebron and Mav's payroll ... if he isn't already.
You been the King of Cleveland while Lebron watched the throne @KyrieIrving! Dont let him punk you!!

Dijeron que cuan cerca est\u00e1 A.Davis de destronar a Lebron de ser el mejor de la liga y viene Lebron y le hace un triple doble. Such is life!

Le quitaron un reb y una ast al triple doble de Lebron. Me cago en ti NBA.
@antiLAKERSpr los numeros pueden estar, pero te garantizo que Rondo en Cavs no har\u00eda un cambio. Lebron sera el que armara el juego.
Jordan era un scorer, lo sabemos, pero nunca se habla que nunca domino el triple. Busquen sus % y comparenlo con los de Lebron y Kobe.
Lebron en la era de Jordan hubiera dominado m\u00e1s que ahora. Minimo pon\u00eda los mismos numeros de ahora. Eran lentisimos para \u00e9l.

Lebron no defiende dec\u00edan.

When Lebron helps his team get a 65-17 or 66-16 record and 5 rings we can call him better than Kobe. Until then shut up Meg

Mo Williams getting blocked by decrepit Jason Terry is more reason to retire than his daddy Lebron abandoning him.
Yeah, Lebron had a better playoff run than KD last year, but you have to factor in the HUGE disparity in the competition.
The degeneration of Lebron is happening right before our very eyes. He's gonna be a Walter McCarty caliber player by the year 2017.
I hope there's not a fly in Lebron's teleportation device he's gonna use to go to his new team after CLE inexorably fails this year.
LMAO @ Lebron being pissed at his teammates for their shitty defense while he was just standing there.
Yep. The guy who's least likely to score RT @AceRozaay I like how Lebron guarding Rondo man

Kyrie shot 3-17 with 9pts. Lebron was held to 11 points on 4-12 shooting. Dion shot 3-11 with 6pts. That can't happen.
@jeremyystevenss Lebron missed Wade so bad right now lol. Skip was right. He is truly missing him lol.
@jeremyystevenss especially try and coach Lebron at that lol. I think they should bring MIke Brown back. Lebron thrived under him.
@jeremyystevenss Lebron thrived under Browns coaching tho lol. He's very defensive minded, Cavs need that. I like Karl too tho.
I think its safe to say Derrick Rose has surpassed Lebron James as the most scrutinized player in the NBA.
@jeremyystevenss nah I think now that Lebron is back in Cleveland there is nothing to really bash him for anymore tbh lol.

He definitely has a lot of Westbrook in him but he can't be Westbrook when he has Love and Lebron
@BigOMoneyRich Ok you have a point there are only like 5 guys like that that are even remotely on KD or Lebron's level including them lol
Kyrie Irving having 4 assists a game is unacceptable with Lebron and Kevin Love on your team.
Ain't no way in hell Lebron drive a KIA lol

@WayneEmbrysKids Lebron is going to show the young guys how to break bad habits by demonstrating really bad habits. #WindhorstLogic
@CSAviate So is Lebron missing shots and throwing TOs on purpose as some kind of lesson? Windhorst is a fool.
@tompestak @WayneEmbrysKids Lebron needs to show them how to win by playing winning basketball. Not by shooting terribly and standing around
@tompestak @WayneEmbrysKids Tom, you said Lebron was slowing down the offense. He needs to start cutting\/passing\/etc like he wants them to
@ESPNCleveland Windhorst once said that Kyrie and Lebron had drifted apart, wouldn't want to play together. He has no credibility on this.
If the @cavs keep playing games like this I will have Lebron's hairline soon.

@CavsWonka I'm not even listening to any of it. And you're right. The second I hear SAS say Lebron might leave I was done. It's nonsense
I like what Lebron just did I remember a cavs vs pelicans game last year where Gordon did nothing but push off and never got called
Btw, did Lebron get number one on top ten for that dunk?
Not to mention Klove and Lebron.
RT @LimrickyDavis: Cavs finally get back on hardwood\nExpecting the team to look very good\nNot afraid of Rajon, we got Lebron\nWin by 20 I th\u2026

Lebron said he owes the fans one. He's getting fitty
RT @CavsNtn: \u201c@Mr_Beautiful323: @CavsNtn U think Lebron could get a triple double ? 10 points, 7 Reb, 5 ast at half\u201d honestly who gives a f\u2026
RT @coli_wally: \*@gifdsports: Lebron splits the defenes finishes with monster dunk  https:\/\/t.co\/a777Wrs8q0\* it was not a monster dunk...di\u2026
If Lebron and Kyrie both get 30 and are also getting double digit assists we won't be beat
Lebron with 22
Looks like Lebron wa the only one to show up

1575299521
@allaccess_nba my guess would be because Kobe shot 3 times more than. Lebron. Kobe doesn't have a supporting cast around him.
Good shot Lebron!
1 more assist for Lebron.
Lebron drops the triple double.
Congrats to Lebron for passing parish for 24th all time on the scoring list.
Lebron still carrying the team. Come on.
Lebron!!!!! Damn!!!! Let's go!
Still can't believe Lebron has taken 27 shots. With still a little over a min left. That's crazy. But working.

Waiting for Lebron to explode on these youngins' for not being a team.
RT @ericj_d: Trade Lebron for Ryan Anderson
Dear Lebron, please reward Joe Harris. The man sprints down the court every possession.
And Lebron with his first triple double of the season
How are we coming down to Lebron jacking up 3\u2019s, Kelly Olynyk shooting J\u2019s and Sullinger killing us with the post?
Lebron looks frustrated
Kyrie put this team on his back. Think Lebron challenged him
Lebron didn\u2019t fall for that pump fake

78222718
Irving and Love got hot at the right time in the game. Lebron carried them to the 4th and they coming through
Lebron finna fuck around and get a triple double
RT @iAintHarden: Damn Kobe the got the record of most missed shots , bum ass Lebron could never achieve that , Kobe a god
Lebron taking a lot of shots tonight
Lebron goin for 40 tonight but they need this win more \ud83d\ude12

Hey, speaking of weird dreams--after Lebron's return to Cleveland turned bittersweet had a dream I was kissing him.  Who knew.
Analyzing it further--as have too much time on my hands--it was as Lebron was returning, I was, too, with my parents.
It was Lebron's return to Cleveland as I almost cancelled a million times the vacation in Hyde Park with my parents--that saw me through.
BUT IT IS OVER.  It's over.  Hip hoppers are gazillionaires, Lebron is king--what more do the brats want?  Durant has his own brilliance.
(Lebron just beat the Chief, Parish--24th for scoring.  Who is all-time--hus looking it up.)

Lebron with 31 and Cleveland down MFin 16 to BOSTON. smh

@sunizbriight35 Lebron being lazy af too. He's pissing me off too, haha.
How tf did Lebron make that? That was a terrible possession.
Not sure why Lebron passed that possession.
@ProSportsTalk0 Lebron gets fouled literally every time he goes the rim. They call it about 30 percent of the time.
C'mon Lebron. Gotta knock these down.
Good shit Lebron.
@sunizbriight35 Lebron didn't even touch the ball. Smh that's just stupid.

Dr. J and Malone were cold but rings talk! Lebron and DWade are legendary
Lebron gets every call he wants. Just like MJ used to.
The way Lebron has been playing this season reminds me of Magic's play style. He's getting his points while keeping his team involved.
Aaaaand Lebron has a triple double.
If you got both Lebron and Kyrie working, you gon slaughter. Getting KLove to get going is a bonus
Celtics better double Lebron. Dude is in clutch mode
Skip: Lebron may be declining.\n\nLebron: *destroys the Celtics*

LRT is so true , we knew the lakers was gone be terrible and that Kobe would shoot hella jumpers, but Lebron but had a scoreless second half

Lebron = Kerchack , anyone who's seen Tarzan understands

Batum completely blew by Lebron, then resets behind a screen, with Lebron still planted at the same spot where he was abandoned.
Lebron is playing at about 75 percent and he has 31 points with 3 minutes left in the third quarter.
Lebron leaves game with Cavs down 6, Cs end quarter on 15-4 run. Non-Lebron Cavs still look clueless\u2026or in the case of Marion\/Miller, done.
Kyrie played a pretty balanced game for 3 quarters, teammates outside of Lebron &amp; Varejao did jack. Now he's gunning, justifiably so.
Lebron has been yelling at his teammates all game about their defense. Because there are no jokes left.
Tommy actually credited Lebron with a great strip of Rondo. In his prime, Tommy would have said Lebron took Rajon's head off.
Lebron's unstoppable in the 4th and Cavs decide to go with Kyrie on a tough contested runner. OK.
@patricktruby It's harsh, but if it were Chris Paul, Lebron, or any other elite player, they'd get roasted. Higher expectations for stars.

Lebron basically said \*Chill out David Blatt. Let Kyrie run this show and stop trying to overcoach\*
If Kyrie Irving had 41 &amp; 7 on 26 shots &amp; love only had 10 shot attempts, media would call Kyrie a ball hog Lebron does it &amp; they praise him
@RyanDalahan I don't know about that. Lebron can't afford to play 82 games at 40 mins a night. He's turning 30 &amp; needs to rest
I think this might be the year Lebron gets injured. He's already less athletic &amp; playing 40 mins a night is too much in your 12th season
@Winkiebaker @CavsPulse just speaking the truth. There's hypocrisy in how Lebron gets treated vs the way Kyrie does
@YungSadBoys2001 @CavsPulse no because the media says Lebron is \*the\* pg. I'm just saying the criticism isn't fair
@CamsDad23 I'm not saying Kyrie doesn't need to learn to share the ball more. I'm saying Lebron gets away with isolation all the time
@YungSadBoys2001 @CavsPulse bro, after Lebron was shooting poorly, media said Lebron \*wasn't trying\*? Another example of Lebron narrative
@YungSadBoys2001 @CavsPulse Forget stats. Just don't like when people don't get treated with privilege. I'm not a Lebron dick-rider like you

Lebron and Kyrie don't fit now?? After 3 games?? Lmaooo! But y'all just said Lebron rigged the NBA to stack this team? They stacked or nah?
@YaDaddy_Phelps I honestly don't think so. Love rebounds good enough to get his own opportunities. Lebron will be more SG than facilitator.
My TL funny. People talking about how Kobe force to many shots. People talking about how Lebron don't force the issue. Make up y'all minds.
Lebron really do look like West Indian Archie.

Jeff green is owning Lebron rn
ESPN fucking biased pieces of shit I have never seen celtics highlights on this channel but they talk about what Lebron shoves up his ass
They actually said the celtics on this damn thing..... Because Lebron played them
They spend more time riding Lebron tiny ass than actually talking about sports
@Pacduneslooper only show good teams like people want to see the same shit over and over listening to what Lebron said about this and that
@Pacduneslooper they talk about the pats only when they do something NFL related they talked about where Lebron went for vacation
@Pacduneslooper I'd rather see sports highlights than what Lebron did for summer just sayin

@MrMojays Wade had Lebron &amp; pre-washed Shaq\u2026 how?
@MrMojays well Lebron &gt; Prime Shaq &gt; pre-washed Shaq &gt; Prime Pau, easily\u2026 plus he had Bosh.
@MrMojays up where? I can name 5 PFs better than him\u2026 can't say the same about Shaq or Lebron @ their respective positions.
@Halestormsports Lebron &gt; prime Shaq &amp; Pre-washed Shaq &gt; Prime PAU, plus he has Bosh.
@BrianNFLinLA @MrMojays I won't deny his greatness, I just ain't putting him in Shaq's or Lebron's class.
@Halestormsports Prime Shaq &amp; Lebron may be a wash, but then there's Bosh.
@Halestormsports I'll give you the Pau\/Bosh wash, but Wade also had Lebron at his greatest\u2026
